## 📌 Lecture Topics Overview

### 🌍 [What is Remote Sensing?](#-what-is-remote-sensing)
Remote sensing is the process of gathering information about an object or environment from a distance, typically using satellites, aircraft, or drones. It plays a crucial role in monitoring the Earth's surface, oceans, and atmosphere.

### 🌞 Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR)
Remote sensing relies on EMR, which travels in waves. Different sensors detect specific wavelengths, allowing them to capture different types of surface features.

### 🌤️ Atmospheric Effects
The atmosphere can absorb, scatter, or distort radiation before it reaches a sensor, influencing the quality of remote sensing data.

### 📡 Passive vs. Active Imaging
Remote sensing systems can be categorized into **passive** (relying on natural light sources, such as the Sun) and **active** (using their own energy source, such as radar or LiDAR).

### 📏 Resolutions - Imaging Properties
The quality and usability of remote sensing data depend on different resolution types:
- **Spatial resolution** (image pixel size)
- **Spectral resolution** (number of detected wavelengths)
- **Radiometric resolution** (sensitivity to intensity differences)
- **Temporal resolution** (frequency of data capture)

## 🌍 What is Remote Sensing?

Remote sensing is the **process of collecting information** about objects from a distance, without the need for physical contact. It is both a **science and an art**, as it involves obtaining and interpreting data about an object, area, or phenomenon through measurements made by instruments that are not in direct contact with the subject (Lillesand et al., 2015).

### 👁️ Detecting Light  

A simple example of remote sensing is **human vision**. Our eyes detect red, green, and blue light, and our brain processes these signals into the full range of visible colors. **Artificial remote sensing systems**, such as cameras, satellites, and sensors, work in a similar way—by detecting and interpreting different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.

### 🛰️ How Remote Sensing Works  

Remote sensing allows scientists to monitor and analyze **Earth’s surface and atmosphere** by measuring the **reflected or emitted radiation** from various objects. Drones, airplanes, and satellites equipped with specialized sensors capture this energy and translate it into usable data.

Depending on the application, **remote sensing sensors** collect data across different parts of the **electromagnetic spectrum** and at various levels of resolution. This helps in characterizing different land areas, water bodies, and atmospheric conditions.

### 🔑 Essential Elements of Remote Sensing  

To perform remote sensing, three key components are required:

1️⃣ **A platform** – A carrier for the sensor, such as a satellite, drone, or aircraft.  
2️⃣ **A target** – The object or area being observed (e.g., land surface, ocean, clouds).  
3️⃣ **An instrument** – A sensor designed to detect and capture specific types of energy.  

These instruments analyze different energy sources and provide insights into **environmental changes, land cover, vegetation health, and more**.
