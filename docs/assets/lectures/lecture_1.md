## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Remote Sensing? {#1-what-is-remote-sensing} üåç  

Remote sensing is the **process of collecting information** about objects from a distance, without the need for physical contact. It is both a **science and an art**, as it involves obtaining and interpreting data about an object, area, or phenomenon through measurements made by instruments that are not in direct contact with the subject (Lillesand et al., 2015).

### üëÅÔ∏è 1.1 Detecting Light  

A simple example of remote sensing is **human vision**. Our eyes detect red, green, and blue light, and our brain processes these signals into the full range of visible colors. **Artificial remote sensing systems**, such as cameras, satellites, and sensors, work in a similar way‚Äîby detecting and interpreting different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.  

### üõ∞Ô∏è 1.2 How Remote Sensing Works  

Remote sensing allows scientists to monitor and analyze **Earth‚Äôs surface and atmosphere** by measuring the **reflected or emitted radiation** from various objects.  
Drones, airplanes, and satellites equipped with specialized sensors capture this energy and translate it into usable data.  

Depending on the application, **remote sensing sensors** collect data across different parts of the **electromagnetic spectrum** and at various levels of resolution.  
This helps in characterizing different land areas, water bodies, and atmospheric conditions.  

![Land Cover Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eo-agh/eo-course/main/docs/assets/images/lecture1_image2.png)  

### üîë 1.3 Essential Elements of Remote Sensing  

To perform remote sensing, three key components are required:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **A platform** ‚Äì A carrier for the sensor, such as a satellite, drone, or aircraft.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **A target** ‚Äì The object or area being observed (e.g., land surface, ocean, clouds).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **An instrument** ‚Äì A sensor designed to detect and capture specific types of energy.  

These instruments analyze different energy sources and provide insights into **environmental changes, land cover, vegetation health, and more**.  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Remote Sensing Platforms {#2-remote-sensing-platforms}  

Remote sensing platforms refer to the **carriers** that house cameras or sensors for data collection.  
These platforms can be **stationary** (e.g., cameras on tripods) or **mobile** (e.g., drones, aircraft, satellites).  
The choice of platform significantly affects the **type, scale, and frequency** of collected imagery.  

---

### üìå 2.1 Types of Remote Sensing Platforms  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ground-Based Platforms üåç  
- Tripods, towers, and vehicles equipped with sensors for close-range remote sensing.  

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Aerial Platforms ‚úàÔ∏è  
- Drones, airplanes, or balloons that operate within the atmosphere, capturing medium-scale imagery.  

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Satellite Platforms üõ∞Ô∏è  
- Orbiting satellites providing large-scale, repetitive coverage of Earth's surface.  

---

### üí∞ 2.2 Cost vs. Coverage Trade-off  

As a general rule, **higher altitude platforms** tend to be **more expensive** but **cover larger areas more efficiently**.  

- A **handheld camera** is inexpensive but impractical for imaging large areas.  
- A **drone** can capture high-resolution imagery at a regional scale.  
- A **satellite** is costly to launch and maintain but can continuously monitor vast portions of the planet.  

üìâ **Resolution Considerations**  
The **farther a platform is from Earth**, the lower the spatial resolution tends to be.  
This means that each pixel in the image represents a larger surface area on Earth.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Electromagnetic Waves {#3-electromagnetic-waves} üåä  

The application of remote sensing sensors and methods relies on the existence of **electromagnetic (EM) radiation**. Whether the radiation is passively measured (e.g., reflection of sunlight) or actively emitted from an instrument, **remote sensing cannot function without this source of energy**.  

But what exactly are **waves**?  

A **wave** is an undulating motion that transports **energy** in the direction of its propagation. A simple example of natural waves can be seen in **water waves** forming after a stone is thrown into a pond. Similarly, **sound waves** are created when we speak or when a police siren passes by.  

### üåû 3.1 Electromagnetic Wave Structure  

Radiation from the Sun travels in the form of **electromagnetic waves**, where **electric** and **magnetic fields** are coupled together.  

An **electromagnetic wave** consists of two perpendicular components:  
- **An electric field (E, blue)**
- **A magnetic field (B, red)**  

The **electric field** oscillates in one plane, while the **magnetic field** oscillates at a right angle to it. Both fields propagate at the **speed of light** (~300,000 km/s).

### üìè 3.2 Wave Characteristics  

Electromagnetic waves are described by three fundamental properties:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Frequency (ŒΩ)** ‚Äì The number of wave cycles (marked by crests) that pass a point in a given time (usually per second).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Wavelength (Œª)** ‚Äì The distance between two successive crests of a wave.  
   - **Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional**:  
     - Higher frequency ‚Üí **shorter wavelength**  
     - Lower frequency ‚Üí **longer wavelength**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Amplitude (A)** ‚Äì The height of the wave from its **rest position** to the **crest** (top) or **trough** (bottom).  
   - **Intensity** (important in remote sensing) is proportional to the square of the amplitude.  

The relationship between these properties can be expressed as:  
\[
\text{frequency} = \frac{\text{speed of light}}{\text{wavelength}}
\]

---

### üî¨ 3.3 Energy and Wavelength  

The **energy of a wave** is directly related to its frequency:  

- **Higher frequency = more energy**  
- **Lower frequency = less energy**  

Thus, **waves with longer wavelengths carry less energy**, while **short-wavelength waves (like X-rays) carry more energy**.  

![Electromagnetic Spectrum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eo-agh/eo-course/main/docs/assets/images/lecture1_image4.png)

## 3.4 The Spectrum of Electromagnetic Radiation  

Electromagnetic energy travels in **waves** and spans a **broad spectrum** ranging from **very long radio waves** to **very short gamma rays**. The **human eye** can detect only a **small portion** of this spectrum, known as **visible light**.  

Other devices, such as **radios**, **X-ray machines**, and **scientific instruments** used in remote sensing, are capable of detecting different regions of the **electromagnetic spectrum (EMS)**. These instruments allow scientists to study not only **Earth** but also **the solar system** and even **the universe beyond**.  

---

### üìä 3.4.1 Electromagnetic Spectrum Overview  

The figure below illustrates the **different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum**, including their:  
- **Names** (radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays)  
- **Wavelengths** (measured in meters, micrometers, or nanometers)  
- **Frequencies** (measured in Hertz)  
- **Energy levels**  

It also highlights the **scale of objects** that can interact with each wavelength and the biological or environmental **influences of different EM radiation types**.  

![EM Spectrum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eo-agh/eo-course/main/docs/assets/images/lecture1_image7.jpg)  

---

### üî¨ 3.4.2 Wavelength, Frequency, and Energy Relationship  

Now that we have discussed the **fundamental properties of EM waves**, we can explore how **photons** are distributed along the **electromagnetic spectrum (EMS)**.  

We know that:  
- **Wavelength and frequency are inversely related** (shorter wavelength = higher frequency).  
- **Photon energy increases as wavelength decreases**.  

#### **Blackbody Radiation and Temperature Dependence**  

The **temperature of an object** affects the **wavelength of radiation it emits**. The figure above also demonstrates this using a **thermometer**, which shows that:  
- **Hotter objects emit shorter wavelengths** of radiation.  
- **Cooler objects emit longer wavelengths** of radiation.  

This relationship follows **Planck's Law**, which describes the emission of electromagnetic radiation from an idealized **blackbody**. A blackbody is a **theoretical object** that absorbs **all incoming radiation** and emits energy based purely on its temperature.  

For example:  
- The **Sun (5788 K)** emits most of its radiation at **~0.5 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∂ m (500 nm, visible light)**.  
- The **human body (~310 K)** emits most of its radiation at **~10‚Åª‚Å¥ m (infrared range, ~10 ¬µm)**.  

üìå **Important Note:** In reality, **blackbodies do not exist**‚Äîreal-world objects always emit slightly less radiation than a perfect blackbody at the same temperature.

### üåû 3.4.3 The Primary Source of Electromagnetic Radiation {#53-the-primary-source-of-electromagnetic-radiation}  

The primary source of energy received on Earth is electromagnetic radiation emitted from the Sun.  

The Sun‚Äôs radiation is reflected and absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and surface. Satellites carry instruments that measure the electromagnetic radiation reflected or emitted.  

![Prim EM Source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eo-agh/eo-course/main/docs/assets/images/lecture1_image8.jpg)  

The Sun emits most of its energy at optical wavelengths, between 0.1 ¬µm to 4 ¬µm. Solar energy, frequently referred to as shortwave radiation, includes ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation. In Earth satellite remote sensing, we are mostly concerned with wavelengths from ultraviolet (0.1 ¬µm) through the microwave (100,000 ¬µm).

### üî¨ 3.4.4 Absorption in the Atmosphere

Understanding where our atmosphere absorbs different parts of the **electromagnetic radiation (EMR)** is crucial for interpreting signals received by **remote sensing instruments**.  

A key distinction between **atmospheric absorption** and **scattering** is the **effective energy loss** to atmospheric constituents. In absorption, energy is **directly transferred** into molecules in the atmosphere or to the **remote sensing targets**.  

Certain **gases in the atmosphere**, such as:  
- **Ozone (O‚ÇÉ)**  
- **Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)**  
- **Water vapor (H‚ÇÇO)**  

can **absorb energy** and contribute to **warming the planet**.

When electromagnetic waves interact with different materials, they exhibit **predictable behaviors**:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Reflection** ‚Äì The wave bounces off a surface (important for optical remote sensing).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Absorption** ‚Äì The wave's energy is absorbed by the material.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Scattering** ‚Äì The wave changes direction randomly (e.g., atmospheric scattering).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Transmission** ‚Äì The wave passes through the material without being absorbed.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Emission & Re-emission** ‚Äì The material releases stored energy as electromagnetic radiation.  

These behaviors are critical in **remote sensing**, as they determine how energy interacts with Earth's surface and atmosphere, affecting how we interpret satellite imagery.

### üåç 3.4.4.1 Atmospheric Windows

From a **remote sensing perspective**, the goal is to use **wavelengths that avoid strong absorption regions** in the atmosphere.  

üìå **Where the atmosphere is highly transmissive to incoming wavelengths, we call these regions "atmospheric windows".**  

The **brown curve** in the diagram below represents the **opaqueness** of the atmosphere.  

- The **big atmospheric windows between 1 mm and 1 m** allow us to operate **microwave remote sensing systems** (e.g., radar sensors).  
- In contrast, **atmospheric windows in the multispectral portions of the EM spectrum** are much **narrower**.  

![Atmospheric Absorption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eo-agh/eo-course/main/docs/assets/images/lecture1_image10.jpg)  

---

### üîÑ 3.4.4.2 Selecting the Right Remote Sensing Instrument  

When designing or choosing **remote sensing sensors**, it is essential to carefully consider the following three questions:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the spectral sensitivity of my sensor?**  
   - Does my sensor operate in a wavelength range affected by atmospheric absorption?  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Which atmospheric windows can be used with this sensor?**  
   - Is my sensor designed to work in regions of high transmissivity?  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the source, magnitude, and composition of the outgoing signal we are aiming to analyze?**  
   - How does the atmosphere influence the signal we receive?  

Selecting an appropriate sensor and **understanding atmospheric absorption** is critical to ensuring the accuracy of **Earth observation data**.  

---

### üîÑ 3.4.4.5 Why Is This Important for Remote Sensing?  

Understanding the **electromagnetic spectrum** is crucial for remote sensing because:  
‚úÖ Different materials interact with specific **wavelengths** of radiation.  
‚úÖ Sensors are designed to detect radiation at different **frequencies** (e.g., infrared for vegetation, microwaves for weather radar).  
‚úÖ The **Earth's atmosphere** absorbs certain wavelengths while allowing others to pass through (this is why certain satellites use infrared or microwave sensors to "see" through clouds).  

This knowledge allows us to design **specialized remote sensing instruments** for applications such as:  
üå± **Vegetation monitoring** (infrared and near-infrared reflectance)  
üèôÔ∏è **Urban mapping** (visible and shortwave infrared)  
üåä **Water quality assessment** (UV and visible light absorption)  
üåé **Climate studies** (microwave and infrared radiation)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Spectral Signatures {#4-spectral-signatures}  

## üîç 4.1 What are Spectral Signatures? {#41-what-are-spectral-signatures}  

Different wavelengths of the **electromagnetic spectrum** interact **differently** with various materials on Earth's surface and in the atmosphere.  

Certain **materials and physical properties** have a unique way of interacting with incident radiation. This interaction is called the **spectral response**‚Äîhow the material reflects, absorbs, or emits radiation.  

üìå **The spectral response of an object is known as its spectral signature.**  

For example:  
- Some materials have a **higher reflectance** at specific wavelengths.  
- The **percent reflectance** is the ratio of **reflected energy** to the total incident energy at a given wavelength.  

### üî¨ Key Concepts  

üü¢ **Radiance**: A measure of the power of electromagnetic radiation emitted from an object per unit area for a given wavelength. In the visible spectrum, radiance is also described as the **brightness** of the source. It is directly proportional to **amplitude** (and intensity) of the wave.  

‚ö™ Surfaces do not only reflect light; they also **partially absorb it**.  

During **absorption**, energy is taken up by the molecules of a material and transformed into **kinetic energy**. This increased molecular movement produces **heat**, which is radiated back to the surroundings.  

üìå **Example:** A **black t-shirt** absorbs more sunlight than a **white t-shirt**, which is why we feel hotter wearing black in summer.  

Albedo measures the **reflective properties** of materials across different spectral ranges:  
- **Albedo = 100%** ‚Üí No absorption, full reflection.  
- **Albedo = 0%** ‚Üí No reflection, full absorption.  

| Material           | Albedo (%) |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **Snow**         | 80-90%    |
| **Cloud**        | 60-90%    |
| **Sand**         | 30%       |
| **Meadow**       | 20%       |
| **Forest**       | 5-18%     |
| **Concrete**     | 15%       |
| **Water (low angle)** | 22%   |
| **Water (high angle)** | 5%   |

![Seasonal Albedo Changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eo-agh/eo-course/main/docs/assets/images/lecture1_image12.jpg)

**Surface Albedo**: The fraction of incident radiation that is **reflected by the Earth's surface** for a given location and time.

## üí° 4.2 Types of Reflection {#42-types-of-reflection}  

The way **electromagnetic waves** interact with surfaces depends on their **roughness**. There are three main types of reflection:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Specular Reflection** (Mirror-like)  
- Occurs when light strikes a **smooth** surface.  
- The **angle of incidence** is equal to the **angle of reflection**.  
- Example: **Glass, still water, metal surfaces**.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Diffuse Reflection**  
- Happens on **rough** surfaces, scattering light in **all directions**.  
- No clear angle of reflection.  
- Example: **Concrete, vegetation, unpolished wood**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Mixed Reflection**  
- The most **common** type in nature.  
- A combination of **specular and diffuse** reflection.  
- Example: **Most natural surfaces like soil, rocks, leaves**.

## üõ∞Ô∏è 4.3 Remote Sensing and Spectral Signatures {#43-remote-sensing-and-spectral-signatures}  

**Remote sensors** are designed to detect **wavelengths** in particular parts of the **electromagnetic spectrum**. These instruments help **identify objects or materials** based on their spectral signatures.  

Let's examine how different materials on Earth interact with **electromagnetic radiation** and define their unique spectral signatures:  

![Spectral Signatures Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eo-agh/eo-course/main/docs/assets/images/lecture1_image12.jpg)

### üçÉ Vegetation  
- Plants absorb **blue and red light** due to **photosynthesis**.  
- **Peak reflectance** occurs in the **green** region (which is why plants appear green).  
- **Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance** is much **higher** than in the visible spectrum.  

---

### üåä Water  
- **Clear water absorbs most radiation**, appearing dark.  
- **Turbid water** reflects **more** light.  
- **Algal blooms increase green reflectance**.  

---

### üèúÔ∏è Soil  
- Soil **moisture content** impacts its spectral signature.  
- **Dry soil** has **higher reflectance** than **wet soil**.  

---

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice & Snow  
- **Fresh snow has high reflectance** across the visible and NIR regions.  
- **Aged or dirty snow absorbs more radiation**, lowering reflectance.  

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Atmosphere  
- Atmospheric **gases and particles** scatter and absorb certain wavelengths.  
- Clouds reflect visible light, making them bright in satellite imagery.  

üìå **Understanding atmospheric interference is crucial** for interpreting remote sensing data correctly.
