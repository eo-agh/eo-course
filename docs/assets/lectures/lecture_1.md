## 1️⃣ What is Remote Sensing? {#1-what-is-remote-sensing} 🌍  

Remote sensing is the **process of collecting information** about objects from a distance, without the need for physical contact. It is both a **science and an art**, as it involves obtaining and interpreting data about an object, area, or phenomenon through measurements made by instruments that are not in direct contact with the subject (Lillesand et al., 2015).

### 👁️ 1.1 Detecting Light  

A simple example of remote sensing is **human vision**. Our eyes detect red, green, and blue light, and our brain processes these signals into the full range of visible colors. **Artificial remote sensing systems**, such as cameras, satellites, and sensors, work in a similar way—by detecting and interpreting different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.  

### 🛰️ 1.2 How Remote Sensing Works  

Remote sensing allows scientists to monitor and analyze **Earth’s surface and atmosphere** by measuring the **reflected or emitted radiation** from various objects.  
Drones, airplanes, and satellites equipped with specialized sensors capture this energy and translate it into usable data.  

Depending on the application, **remote sensing sensors** collect data across different parts of the **electromagnetic spectrum** and at various levels of resolution.  
This helps in characterizing different land areas, water bodies, and atmospheric conditions.

### 🔑 1.3 Essential Elements of Remote Sensing  

To perform remote sensing, three key components are required:  

1️⃣ **A platform** – A carrier for the sensor, such as a satellite, drone, or aircraft.  
2️⃣ **A target** – The object or area being observed (e.g., land surface, ocean, clouds).  
3️⃣ **An instrument** – A sensor designed to detect and capture specific types of energy.  

These instruments analyze different energy sources and provide insights into **environmental changes, land cover, vegetation health, and more**.

## 2️⃣ Remote Sensing Platforms {#2-remote-sensing-platforms}  

Remote sensing platforms refer to the **carriers** that house cameras or sensors for data collection.  
These platforms can be **stationary** (e.g., cameras on tripods) or **mobile** (e.g., drones, aircraft, satellites).  
The choice of platform significantly affects the **type, scale, and frequency** of collected imagery.

### 📌 2.1 Types of Remote Sensing Platforms  

#### 1️⃣ Ground-Based Platforms 🌍  
- Tripods, towers, and vehicles equipped with sensors for close-range remote sensing.  

#### 2️⃣ Aerial Platforms ✈️  
- Drones, airplanes, or balloons that operate within the atmosphere, capturing medium-scale imagery.  

#### 3️⃣ Satellite Platforms 🛰️  
- Orbiting satellites providing large-scale, repetitive coverage of Earth's surface.

### 💰 2.2 Cost vs. Coverage Trade-off  

As a general rule, **higher altitude platforms** tend to be **more expensive** but **cover larger areas more efficiently**.  

- A **handheld camera** is inexpensive but impractical for imaging large areas.  
- A **drone** can capture high-resolution imagery at a regional scale.  
- A **satellite** is costly to launch and maintain but can continuously monitor vast portions of the planet.  

📉 **Resolution Considerations**  
The **farther a platform is from Earth**, the lower the spatial resolution tends to be.  
This means that each pixel in the image represents a larger surface area on Earth.
