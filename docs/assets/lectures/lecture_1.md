## 📌 Lecture Topics Overview

### 🌍 What is Remote Sensing?
Remote sensing is the process of gathering information about an object or environment from a distance, typically using satellites, aircraft, or drones. It plays a crucial role in monitoring the Earth's surface, oceans, and atmosphere.

### 🌞 Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR)
Remote sensing relies on EMR, which travels in waves. Different sensors detect specific wavelengths, allowing them to capture different types of surface features.

### 🌤️ Atmospheric Effects
The atmosphere can absorb, scatter, or distort radiation before it reaches a sensor, influencing the quality of remote sensing data.

### 📡 Passive vs. Active Imaging
Remote sensing systems can be categorized into **passive** (relying on natural light sources, such as the Sun) and **active** (using their own energy source, such as radar or LiDAR).

### 📏 Resolutions - Imaging Properties
The quality and usability of remote sensing data depend on different resolution types:
- **Spatial resolution** (image pixel size)
- **Spectral resolution** (number of detected wavelengths)
- **Radiometric resolution** (sensitivity to intensity differences)
- **Temporal resolution** (frequency of data capture)
