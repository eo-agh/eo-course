# **Guidelines for Semester Projects – Summer 2025**

## **1. General Information**
Semester projects are a key component of course assessment, carrying a weight of **0.7** in the final grade.  
Each project team consists of **two students** (except in cases of an odd number of students, where one team may have three members).  

Each project must have:  
- A **dedicated GitHub repository**.  
- A **GitHub Pages site** where data, code, documentation, sources, and bibliography will be published.  

---

## **2. Project Evaluation & Conference Presentation**
The final evaluation of the project takes place through a **poster presentation** at the student poster session during the  
**VIIIth Space Resources Conference – Path to Lunar Sustainability**, held on **May 21-23, 2025, at AGH University of Krakow, Poland** ([spaceconf.org](https://spaceconf.org)).  

### **Important Deadlines**
- **March 15, 2025** – Each team must submit an abstract of their project to the conference system.  
- **May 21-23, 2025** – Poster presentation and project defense at the conference.  

### **Presentation Requirements**
- Each project team must prepare a **poster** using **Canva/Figma**.  
- The poster will be presented during the conference, where the instructor and conference attendees will ask questions. Answering these questions will be considered equivalent to **defending the project**.  
- Each poster must include a **QR code** linking to the **GitHub Pages site** of the project.

## **3. Research Groups & Project Support**
Projects must be conducted **within student research groups**, preferably those officially registered at the  
**AGH Center for Space Technologies**, e.g. ([AGH STARS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/agh-stars/)).

Being part of a research group offers students access to:  
- **Expert knowledge**,  
- **Specialized equipment**,  
- **Funding opportunities**, including field research trips.
