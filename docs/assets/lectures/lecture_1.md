## 1️⃣ What is Remote Sensing? {#1-what-is-remote-sensing}  

Remote sensing is the **process of collecting information** about objects from a distance, without the need for physical contact.  

It is both a **science and an art**, as it involves obtaining and interpreting data about an object, area, or phenomenon through measurements made by instruments that are not in direct contact with the subject (Lillesand et al., 2015).

### 🔍 1.1 Detecting Light  

A simple example of remote sensing is **human vision**. Our eyes detect red, green, and blue light, and our brain processes these signals into the full range of visible colors.  

Similarly, **artificial remote sensing systems** (e.g., cameras, satellites, sensors) detect and interpret different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.

## 2️⃣ Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) {#2-electromagnetic-radiation-emr}  

### 🌊 2.1 Electromagnetic Wave Structure {#21-electromagnetic-wave-structure}  

Radiation from the Sun travels in the form of **electromagnetic waves**, where **electric** and **magnetic fields** are coupled together.

---

### 🌈 2.2 Electromagnetic Spectrum {#22-electromagnetic-spectrum}  

Electromagnetic energy spans a **broad spectrum**, from **very long radio waves** to **very short gamma rays**.  

The **human eye** can detect only a **small portion** of this spectrum, known as **visible light**.

### ☀️ 2.3 The Primary Source of EM Radiation {#23-the-primary-source-of-em-radiation}  

The primary source of energy received on Earth is **electromagnetic radiation from the Sun**.  

The Sun emits most of its energy at optical wavelengths, between **0.1 µm to 4 µm**, including **ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation**.

## 3️⃣ Atmospheric Effects {#3-atmospheric-effects}  

### 🌍 3.1 Absorption in the Atmosphere {#31-absorption-in-the-atmosphere}  

Certain **gases in the atmosphere**, such as:  
- **Ozone (O₃)**  
- **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**  
- **Water vapor (H₂O)**  

can **absorb energy** and contribute to **warming the planet**.

### 🌫️ 3.2 Atmospheric Windows {#32-atmospheric-windows}  

📌 **Where the atmosphere is highly transmissive to incoming wavelengths, we call these regions "atmospheric windows".**

## 4️⃣ Spectral Signatures {#4-spectral-signatures}  

### 🔬 4.1 What are Spectral Signatures? {#41-what-are-spectral-signatures}  

Each material interacts uniquely with electromagnetic radiation, producing a **spectral signature** that allows scientists to identify objects remotely.  

---

### 💡 4.2 Types of Reflection {#42-types-of-reflection}  

1️⃣ **Specular Reflection** – Occurs on **smooth** surfaces (e.g., water, metal).  
2️⃣ **Diffuse Reflection** – Occurs on **rough** surfaces (e.g., vegetation, soil).  
3️⃣ **Mixed Reflection** – A combination of both, **common in nature**.  

---

### ☀️ 4.3 Absorption and Albedo {#43-absorption-and-albedo}  

📌 **Albedo measures the degree of reflection of materials in different spectral ranges.**  

| Material       | Albedo (%) |
|---------------|-----------|
| Snow         | 80-90%    |
| Sand         | 30%       |
| Forest       | 5-18%     |
| Water (low angle) | 22%   |
